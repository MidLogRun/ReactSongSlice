~~~ Meeting 2 Notes (11/1?/23) ~~~
To Dos:
- Before fall break; storyboard detailed, assignees, user acceptance criteria, user acceptance document look at UAD templates for testing/creating an account
- Need another column for them - acceptance criteria (specify what is expected for that scenario - throw error if unsuccessful)
- Another column - test scenario with automated test 
- UAD document in tabular form
- "Create a simple app that works well. start simple. make sure it all works well"
    with init data ins/create - have drop tables (with nodemon), that way when testing with nodemon it refreshes our data
