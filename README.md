# Song Slice - README

## Introduction

Song Slice is an app designed for music enthusiasts to rate, review, and discuss their favorite songs. This app aims not only to help you find your favorite song but also to help you connect with a community of others who enjoy the same music.

## Features

### 1. Ratings

Users can rate any song out of five stars, and you can see what percentage of people liked any song. This helps you get an overall opinion of people's thoughts before listening to the song or reading the comments.

### 2. Reviews

Once you are done listening to a song, you can have conversations with others about what you thought about the song in the comment section below each song. This is a great place to join a community of others who enjoy the same songs.

### 3. Song Discovery

Discover songs based on the most popular songs of the week in the discovery section. This is a great way to find new songs and make new friends.

### 4. Library

You can save your favorite songs in your library for easy access later. This can be especially useful if you are conversing with someone in the comments of one of your favorite songs.

### 5. Spotify Integration

Go to any song on Spotify with the click of a button and listen to any song for free. No need to bust out the wallet!
(of course, Apple Music is better... but you know. You get what you pay for)
