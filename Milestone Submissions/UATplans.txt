User Acceptance Testing:

    Unit tests for API routes:
        login test has been created
        User can't login unless they provide username and password
            username must match entry in DB
            password must match corresponding hashed password
        If username does not exist in DB, prompt user with try again and/or register

        TODO: registration testing
        User can't register unless they provide: username, email address, password, confirm password
            Username must be unique -> Query the database for any existing username that matches user input
            User must enter a password -> confirm_password field must match each character in password field
